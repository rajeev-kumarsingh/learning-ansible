# Introduction to Ansible

- Ansible provides an open-source automation that reduces complexity and runs anywhere. Using Ansible let you automate virtually any task. Here are some common use cases for ANSIBLE
  - Eliminate repeatation and simplyfy workflow
  - Manage and maintain system configuration
  - Continuously deploy complex software
  - Perform zero downtime rolling updates.
- Ansible uses simple, human readable scripts called `playbooks` to automate your task. You declare the desired state of a local or remote system in your `playbook`. Ansible ensure that system remains in that state.
- As automation technology, Ansible is designed around the following principles:
  - `Agent-less Architecture`: Low maintainance overhead by avoiding the installation of additional software across IT infrastructure. -`Simplicity`: Automation playbooks use straight foeward YAML syntax for code that read like documentation. Ansible is also decentralized, using SSH with existing OS credentials to access to remote machine .
